### Autonomous Multirotor Research
  The lab has a fleet of various multirotor aircraft equiped with Pixhawk flight controllers and GoPro cameras which we use for a multitude of different projects including data collection over volcanoes, autonomous landing on a vehicle, and photogrametry.
  Project Pages: (coming soon)

### Gator Ground Vehicle Research
  We are working on autonomous navagation of ground vehicles to assist air vehicles by extending the range of our autonomous systems.  These vehicles will autonomously carry an air vehicle to areas inaccesssible by humans, then launch the air vehicle to collect data, recover the air vehicle, and return.
  
### LavaBot
  LavaBot is a dually faceted mission, incorporating a squadron of fully autonomous land and air vehicles. The aim of LavaBot is to climb a volcano and retreive samples from within it; to do so, we must be able to identify paths up the volcano from the air, relay those paths to the ground vehicles, launch and land multirotors on small platforms on the moving land vehicles, charge multirotors from the landing platform, and collect samples from within the volcano.
  
### Edwin Coworker Robot
  Edwin is a robotic arm which we are turning into a friendly robot which can intuitively interact with people.
