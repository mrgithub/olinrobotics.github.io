### Autonomous Multirotor Research
  The lab has a fleet of various multirotor aircraft equiped with Pixhawk flight controllers and GoPro cameras which we use for a multitude of different projects including data collection over volcanoes, autonomous landing on a vehicle, and photogrametry.

### Gator Ground Vehicle Research
  We are working on autonomous navagation of ground vehicles to assist air vehicles by extending the range of our autonomous systems.  These vehicles will autonomously carry an air vehicle to areas inaccesssible by humans, then launch the air vehicle to collect data, recover the air vehicle, and return.
  
### LavaBot
  LavaBot is a dual-faceted mission: A squadron of fully autonomous land and air vehicles will be utilized to climb a volcano and retrieve samples from within it. To achieve these objectives, the air vehicles must be able to identify paths up the volcano and relay those paths to the ground vehicles. In addition, we must be able to autonomously land multirotors on small platforms mounted on the moving land vehicles, charge them from the landing platforms, and launch them again to collect samples from within the volcano.

### Edwin Coworker Robot
  Edwin is a robotic arm which we are turning into a friendly robot which can intuitively interact with people. Edwin communicates mainly through gesture and body posture- the universal language.
  
### RFID-Enabled Fish Tagging
  In order to assist marine biologists in tracking highly migratory species of fish such as Tuna and Billfish, the IV Lab, in partnership with the Large Pelagics Lab, has been developing an alternative tagging platform denoted "HI-Tags," which encompass modern technology such as RFID, bluetooth, and mobile application to integrate a seamless tagging procedure within the fishing experience.
