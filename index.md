### Autonomous Multirotor Research
  The lab has a fleet of various multirotor aircraft equipped with Pixhawk flight controllers and GoPro cameras. We use this fleet for a multitude of different projects, including data collection over volcanoes, autonomous landing on a vehicle, and photogrammetry.

  [Here is more about these projects](Multirotors)

### ORCAS - Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Research
  <p>The lab is working on building a fleet of autonomous underwater platforms
  capable of autonomous navigation and operation. The vehicles are planned to
  use Pixhawk flight controllers and ODROID single board computers so as to
  provide an identical interface to the lab's other autonomous vehicles. The
  sensors and payloads will be customizable to allow for a wide range of
  possible missions.</p>

### Edwin Coworker Robot
  Edwin is an SR-17 robotic arm that was retrofitted to create a friendly robot that could intuitively interact with people. Current work on Edwin includes handwritten communication, object recognition and tracking, vocal commands, and more.

### Gator_Ground_Vehicle_Research
  We are working on autonomous navigation of ground vehicles, which will assist our air vehicles by extending the flight range of our autonomous systems.  These vehicles will autonomously carry an air vehicle to areas inaccessible by humans, then launch the air vehicle to collect data, recover the air vehicle, and return.

### LavaBot
  LavaBot is a dual-faceted mission: A squadron of fully autonomous land and air vehicles will be utilized to climb a volcano and retrieve samples from within it. To achieve these objectives, the air vehicles must be able to identify paths up the volcano and relay those paths to the ground vehicles. In addition, we must be able to autonomously land multirotors on small platforms mounted on the moving land vehicles, charge them from the landing platforms, and launch them again to collect samples from within the volcano.

### RFID-Enabled Fish Tagging
  In order to assist marine biologists in tracking highly migratory species of fish such as Tuna and Billfish, the IV Lab, in partnership with the Large Pelagics Lab, has been developing an alternative tagging platform denoted "HI-Tags," which encompass modern technology such as RFID, bluetooth, and mobile application to integrate a seamless tagging procedure within the fishing experience.
