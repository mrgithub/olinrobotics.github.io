#### 4 ESC Speed controllers

Consult [Ardupilot](http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/connect-escs-and-motors.html) for your specific type of quadcopter and plug the ESCs into your Pixhawk's MAIN OUT channels 1-4 in the correct order.

## Minimum Requirements

This is a list of the absolute minimum number of parts you need installed to operate your vehicle safely in different modes.

#### Quadcopter

To fly in Stabilize Mode (on a copter) or drive in Manual mode (on a rover) you will need...

 - A Pixhawk with correct firmware and calibration uploaded
 - A [battery](http://images6.wheelspinmodels.co.uk/EFLB0998-a47e.jpg), typically a 3 cell (11.1 volts, 5100 milliamp-hours)
 - [BEC voltage regulator](../images/BEC.png)
 - The appropriate number of motors for your vehicle
 - The same number of [ESCs](../images/ESC.png) as motors (Quad, Hex, Octo, etc etc -Copters only)
 - A motor controller, such as a [Sabertooth](https://www.dimensionengineering.com/datasheets/Sabertooth2x12.pdf) or a [Kangaroo](https://www.dimensionengineering.com/datasheets/KangarooManual.pdf) (Ground vehicles only)
 - An RC receiver radio, preferably a [DSMX](../images/Receiver.jpg) or equivalent
 - A RC transmitter that has been [bound](link) to the RC receiver
 
To fly in Loiter or Auto Mode, or drive in Hold or Auto Mode, you will need...
- All of the above
- A [GPS](../images/GPS.png)
- A Compass (Your Pixhawk contains an internal compass.)

Use of a [Buzzer](../images/Speaker.jpg) and [Telemetry equipment](../images/Telem.jpg) is optional, but highly encouraged, as they make debugging a lot easier (and safer!)

## Calibrating Settings

Calibrate these before your first flight.
