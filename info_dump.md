# Cross Project Info
This page is a collection of documentation for aspects of different robo lab projects which may be useful for multiple different projects.  It should contain short descriptions of the work you did with links to full documentation of what you did.

## Odroid and Intercomputer Communication
Odroids are computers on a chip which we would like to mount on air vehicles to run code on boad the vehicle, rather than sending information down to a ground computer and sending control signals back up.

Work towards this goal includes setting up odroid computers, multiple methods of communicating between computers, and direct communication between a computer and the pixhawk and gopro in flight.

## Pixhawk Setup
The Pixhawk, which is produced by 3DR, is the main flight controller currently in use in the Olin Intelligent Vehicles Lab. Pixhawks enable easy monitoring of quadcopters and other robotic vehicles, for quick debugging, increased safety, and better data collection from missions. Pixhawks enable autonomous vehicles to travel to a series of GPS waypoints, which can be independently created, maintained, and edited from Ground Control Station.
