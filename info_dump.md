# Cross Project Info
This page is a collection of documentation for aspects of different robo lab projects which may be useful for multiple different projects.  It should contain short descriptions of the work you did with links to full documentation of what you did.

## Odroid and Intercomputer Communication
Odroids are computers on a chip which we would like to mount on air vehicles to run code on boad the vehicle, rather than sending information down to a ground computer and sending control signals back up.

Work towards this goal includes setting up odroid computers, multiple methods of communicating between computers, and direct communication between a computer and the pixhawk and gopro in flight.
